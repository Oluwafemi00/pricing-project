# Sleek Dynamic Pricing App

A high-performance, responsive pricing table component designed with modern UI/UX principles. This project demonstrates a transition from static "spaghetti" code to a modular, data-driven architecture.

## Features

- **Live Currency Conversion**: Integrates with the [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.dev/) to fetch real-time exchange rates for USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY.
- **Dynamic Billing Logic**: Toggle between monthly and yearly billing with an automatic 20% discount calculation.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Includes a theme-switcher with user preference persistence via `localStorage`.
- **Responsive & Sleek UI**: Built using CSS Grid and Glassmorphism effects. Fully responsive from mobile to ultra-wide displays.
- **Semantic & Accessible**: Uses HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<label>`) for better SEO and screen-reader support.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Grid, Flexbox, and Glassmorphism.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Async/Await for API calls, DOM manipulation, and state management.

## How It Works

### Data-Driven Rendering

The app separates content from logic. Pricing plans are stored in a JavaScript object, allowing for easy updates without touching the HTML structure.

### Live Exchange Rates

The app uses the `Intl.NumberFormat` API to ensure that currency symbols and decimal places are formatted correctly according to international standards.

```javascript
// Example of the live conversion logic
let price = isYearly ? plan.usd * 0.8 : plan.usd;
let convertedPrice = (price * rates[currency]).toLocaleString(undefined, {
  style: "currency",
  currency: currency,
});
```
